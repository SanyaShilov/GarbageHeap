# GarbageHeap

GarbageHeap is a very simple memory management tool.
In main, before any operation, you initialize it,
after that you can use gmalloc, gcalloc and grealloc instead of
stdlib functions and you don't need to free the memory and care about it.
In the end of main, just free the GarbageHeap.
Enjoy it!
